# The Game Refinery

I started laying out an idea for a multipage website I have to help develop/refine board game ideas.

I had no previous experience with routing, so I started just using state/hooks and quickly found out how involved routing can get.

I did a lot of work with the SVG icons used to display information about the sample games. Play length, player count, and development stage influence how the icons are shown.
